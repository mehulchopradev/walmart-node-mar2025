- We need to build a copy utility (library) function
  - source
  - destination
  - non blocking IO

  - this utility function is suppose to inform its consumer(s) at the various stages in the lifecycle of the asynchronous operation that
  it is doing
    - inform when the read operation is done
    - inform when the write operation is done
    - inform when the read operation is failure
    - inform when the write operation is a failure


- Priority of the queues that the event loop (single thread) goes through
  1. Current code (synchronous code) - main code
  2. Next ticks queue
  3. Microtasks queue
  4. I/O events callback queue
  5. Timers queue
