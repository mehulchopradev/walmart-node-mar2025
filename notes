- We need to build a copy utility (library) function
  - source
  - destination
  - non blocking IO

  - this utility function is suppose to inform its consumer(s) at the various stages in the lifecycle of the asynchronous operation that
  it is doing
    - inform when the read operation is done
    - inform when the write operation is done
    - inform when the read operation is failure
    - inform when the write operation is a failure
